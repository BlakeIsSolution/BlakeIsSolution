At BiS we believe that providing a personalized customer experience while placing the customer’s priorities as our priority is the priority. 

Now that’s a mouthful! But is it true.

We strive to identify what our customers want, do our best to fulfill their needs and requirements with the products and services that we offer. 

For us, putting our customers (and vendor partners) first isn’t a strategy, it’s a culture.

For over 2 decades the team at BiS has dedicated themselves to developing software that  is innovative and easy to use. 

We are experts at what we do and we make it easy to do business with us. Together we help you get to where you want to be.
